        title: "Understanding Temperature Anomalies",
        content: "Global temperature anomaly refers to the deviation of the observed temperature from a long-term average, or baseline. In this dashboard, we use a standard baseline period to compare recent years against historical norms. Positive anomalies indicate warming trends, while negative anomalies suggest cooling. This metric is crucial because it filters out local weather variability to reveal the underlying climate signal."

    co2: {
        title: "Carbon Intensity & Emissions",
        content: "Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas driving anthropogenic climate change. We visualize atmospheric CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm). The correlation between rising CO2 levels and temperature anomalies is a key focus of this dashboard, visually demonstrating the greenhouse effect."
    },
    interpretation: {
        title: "Interpreting the Data",
        content: "When using the dashboard, look for coupled trends: as CO2 (green area chart) rises, observe the corresponding shift in temperature anomalies (red bars) towards positive values. The map view provides spatial context, highlighting regions that are warming faster than the global average, such as polar regions or specific continental landmasses."
